# The Initial Driver needs to Make sure to:
# download the files below, create a local folder for the project, create a github repository, commit the inital files, share the link

# Both navigators should then:
# fork the code, clone it and begin.

# Here's an article on doing so -- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3903817/pull-new-updates-from-original-github-repository-into-forked-github-repository

# Your parking gargage class should have the following methods:
# - takeTicket
# - This should decrease the amount of tickets available by 1
# - This should decrease the amount of parkingSpaces available by 1
# - payForParking
# - Display an input that waits for an amount from the user and store it in a variable
# - If the payment variable is not empty then (meaning the ticket has been paid) -> display a message to the user that their ticket has been paid and they have 15mins to leave
# - This should update the "currentTicket" dictionary key "paid" to True
# -leaveGarage
# - If the ticket has been paid, display a message of "Thank You, have a nice day"
# - If the ticket has not been paid, display an input prompt for payment
# - Once paid, display message "Thank you, have a nice day!"
# - Update parkingSpaces list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the parkingSpaces list)
# - Update tickets list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the tickets list)

# You will need a few attributes as well:
# - tickets -> list
# - parkingSpaces -> list
# - currentTicket -> dictionary
